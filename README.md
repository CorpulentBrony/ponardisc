**Pon**y **Ar**chive **Disc**ord Bot
------------------------------------
This bot will provide the functionality to archive a text channel from Discord.  Initially this will be for historical archives, but I would like to get it to the point of doing real time archiving.  This will include embedded images, videos, files, and links to images, videos, and files, but not necessarily following embedded Web pages.  It will also include things like user profile pictures and user name changes over time (only for real time).
